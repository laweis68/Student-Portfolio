## 📂 IS181 Final Project Overview
Project Title: TikTok and Data Privacy: Navigating the Ethical Implications of User Data Collection

Objective: To analyze the ethical implications of TikTok’s data privacy practices, particularly its collection and handling of user data. The study examines concerns related to user consent, data transparency, and potential national security risks, especially regarding TikTok’s alleged ties to the Chinese government. By comparing TikTok’s practices to past data privacy controversies, such as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, the research aims to highlight regulatory gaps and propose ethical solutions that balance innovation, user privacy, and corporate responsibility.
